        <p>Hi, I’m Jennifer Rutledge—logistics wizard by day, creative maker by night. With over a decade of experience in operations and supply chain management, I’ve built a career on keeping things running smoothly behind the scenes. From freight coordination and order fulfillment to process improvement and customer support, I thrive on solving problems and making the complex feel simple. But when the spreadsheets close and the emails pause, you’ll find me pouring that same passion for detail into Scrumpdilly Creations—my small business dedicated to making fun, quirky, and custom-branded goodies. Whether it’s a cheeky gift, a personalized item, or something to brighten your day, I believe creativity should feel a little playful and a lot personal. Here, I get to blend my love for planning and process with the joy of crafting something people actually smile about.

        Thanks for stopping by—I’m so glad you’re here.</p>
